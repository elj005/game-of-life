# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Conway's Game of Life in command line coded in PHP.

## How to Run

Unzip sidekicker.zip. Open your terminal, go to sidekicker folder and run:

```
$ php src/console/play.php
```

I also added a script to play a glider:

```
$ php src/console/glider.php
```

And, a script to play a lightweight spaceship:

```
$ php src/console/lwss.php
```

Enjoy!
